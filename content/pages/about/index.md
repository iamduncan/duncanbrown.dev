For over 10 years I have been working on the in house design, build and
maintenance of marketing websites. These have been mostly built using WordPress.

I am also passionate about streamlining workflows and implementing automation to
avoid repetitive tasks. Therefore, I created several applications to make
business processes faster and reduce repetition. I used this to further my
knowledge of many technologies.

Whilst in the past I have used cakePHP for a basic web application, python for
data processing and JQuery for user interface applications. I am now using
Symfony for creating RESTful api back ends, React JS for creating progressive
web apps. I use Gatsby for creating fast and simple static websites and
WordPress for creating full featured blog, marketing and ecommerce websites.

As with many other developers, I am always on the lookout for the latest shiny
technology stack.

On this blog I intend to write posts about the technologies I am using and
learning, primarily for self documentation. I will also use it as a place to try
out fresh ideas and to work on some best practices.
